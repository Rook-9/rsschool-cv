### Code example: 
**Codewars KATA**
Trolls are attacking your comment section!
A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.
Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.
For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".
Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.
**Solution**
```
function disemvowel(str) {
  const regex = /[aeiou]/gi;
  const newStr = str.replace(regex, '');
  return newStr;
}
```
